Lansing, Michigan - June 13th, 2020 -
During the government-mandated lockdown, one developer and his wife used their extra free time and collective skill sets to develop a <a href="https://contactlesskiosk.com">contact tracing tool</a> to help Americans stay safe during this global pandemic. Brandi and Eric Pettway of Trumpet Marketing Technologies Inc. in Lansing, Michigan have developed a safety technology that performs contact tracing in a more effective way than any contact tracing app on the market. 
TrumpetBox gives you the power to deliver your kiosk interface to multiple clients simultaneously on their mobile devices and collect relevant information directly from them at distances of 30 plus feet away.
Also, data collected with the TrumpetBox is compatible with our TrumpetBox SMS rapid notification system designed to help quickly make contact tracing notifications or other marketing alerts easy and affordable.
Eric Pettway stated, "While we deal with the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to equip everyday people with tools to help protect everyone's wellbeing. The number one weapon in our war chest is socially distancing from others. This solution is a precautionary measure to protect our health until they develop a medical solution. TrumpetBox makes common technology already in everyone's possession a part of the answer to communicating at a distance. TrumpetBox also can save states and governments millions of dollars!"
The couples recent Kickstarter campaign presents a complete <a href="https://contactlesskiosk.com">turnkey contactless kiosk solution</a> that has the flexibility to be useful in every industry. It runs on low power devices, time stamps data, has temperature management, works across device types, requires no cellular data or internet, deploys fast, can scale quickly, and it safely shuts down and reboots to protect data. With our smart kiosk software network, you can replace standard forms, improve safety conditions, perform  <a href="https://contactlesskiosk.com">contact tracing service</a> with ease, eliminate germ transfer, and increase work productivity.
When used with TrumpetBox SMS add-on you have a complete solution for the responsible planning of small to large crowd contact tracing  and have a rapid notification process in place. All public facing businesses will have a resposibility to the public to protect the people who patronize those establishments that includes informing them if exposed by a person at their location, i.e. a sick receptionist.
